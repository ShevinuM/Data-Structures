/**
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * 
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, the task is to find a peak element, and return its index. 
 * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 *
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
 * In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
 *              or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 * nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
 */

/*
 * This solution uses binary search. We check if the middle element is a peak, if it is we return true. The peak element
 * is stored in the beak variable instead of returning it. Instead, I'm returning true or false to indicate if a peak was 
 * found. If the peak is found we can return true and stop the recursion.
