# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository consisting of over 155+ Leetcode problems! This is where I track my ongoing journey to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I came across this area of CS in college and it continues to fascinate me with its breadth and depth. I like how complex certain problems can get and I love problem solving and math in general.

## What Languages Have I Used

Most of the problems are solved in Java, but I have also solved a few in Python.

## How The Repository Is Organized

This repository is organized by particular data structures / Algorithms, so all problems I come across related to a specific data structure/algorithm goes inside it. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of algorithms/data structures I'm not yet aware of so I occasionally add new folders whenever I come across a new concept.

## Origin Story

During my college years, I was introduced to various data structures. But like any vast topic, I found it challenging to retain everything. I understood what each data structure is but when I had to implement it, I was clueless. I knew I needed to find a practical way to solidify these concepts, and thus, my coding journey outside of classroom learning began. I started with implementing basic data structures, such as Linked Lists, from scratch.

### Discovering HackerRank and LeetCode

As I went deeper into coding, I discovered HackerRank. I used hacker rank to prepare for my school exams as I found studying DSA to be a bit boring and putting everything into practice would be much more interesting. My knowledge and understanding started to broaden, and soon, I stumbled across more advanced concepts through various YouTube tutorials. This led me to LeetCode. I found this platform extremely valuable since the questions covered almost any data structure/algorithm and they had plenty of questions to do. Back when I started doing leetcode problems, I was clueless but now I understand so much about how data structures work.
