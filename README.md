# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository! This is where I track my ongoing journey of deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms. This subject, which I came across in college, continues to fascinate me with its breadth and depth. I'm intigued by it's complexity and find problem solving fascinating

## Origin Story

During my college years, I was introduced to various data structures. But like any vast topic, I found it challenging to retain everything. I knew I needed to find a practical way to solidify these concepts, and thus, my coding journey outside of classroom learning began. I started with implementing basic data structures, such as Linked Lists, from scratch.

## Discovering HackerRank and LeetCode

As I delved more into the world of coding, I discovered HackerRank - a platform full of interesting coding problems. I used hacker rank to prepare for my school exams as i found studying DSA to be a bit boring and putting everything into practice would be much more interesting. My knowledge and understanding started to broaden, and soon, I stumbled across more advanced concepts through various YouTube tutorials. This led me to LeetCode, a platform with an extensive library of problems that cover an array of topics in data structures and algorithms. I found this platform extremely valuable, and many of the problems you'll see here are solutions to some leetcode problems. 

## Continuous Learning and Updates

This repository is more than just a collection of problems and solutions; it's a testament to my passion for learning and my commitment to enhancing my coding skills.

While many problems here are from LeetCode, I also like to participate in coding competitions and events. This repository is fairly new so none of the solutions to my past problems I've solved aren't here but from here on I'll make sure to update this repository with relevant learnings and insights. I'm particularly excited about the upcoming Advent of Code in December!

## Going Forward

I invite you to follow along on this journey of continuous learning and improvement. Feel free to explore the problems, understand the solutions, and even offer your insights. I hope that this repository can serve not just as my personal coding diary, but also as a valuable resource for anyone passionate about data structures and algorithms.
