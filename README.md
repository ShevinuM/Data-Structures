# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository! This is where I track my ongoing journey to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I came across this area of CS in college and it continues to fascinate me with its breadth and depth. I like how compelx certain problems can get and I love problem solving and math in general.

## What Languages Have I Used

I am proficient in both Python and Java, however with experience in developing applications using Python and Java both, Java's strict Object Oriented nature intrigued me a lot as most applications I make resemble real life object which closely aligns the code with the way I think. Another few reasons, I prefer Java is it's strict type checking and it's available libraries particulary Spring Boot which I prefer over Python's Flask. I initially started doing DSA problems with Python since it was easier for me to code but I'm slowly transitioning to Java since my projects will mostly incorporate Java as well.

## How The Repository Is Organized

This repository is organized by particular data structures / Algorithms, so all problems I come across related to a specific data structure / algorithm goes inside it. I'm pretty sure there's plenty of algorithms / data structures I'm not yet aware of so I occassionally add new folders whenever I come across a new concept.

## Origin Story

During my college years, I was introduced to various data structures. But like any vast topic, I found it challenging to retain everything. I knew I needed to find a practical way to solidify these concepts, and thus, my coding journey outside of classroom learning began. I started with implementing basic data structures, such as Linked Lists, from scratch.

## Discovering HackerRank and LeetCode

As I delved more into the world of coding, I discovered HackerRank - a platform full of interesting coding problems. I used hacker rank to prepare for my school exams as i found studying DSA to be a bit boring and putting everything into practice would be much more interesting. My knowledge and understanding started to broaden, and soon, I stumbled across more advanced concepts through various YouTube tutorials. This led me to LeetCode, a platform with an extensive library of problems that cover an array of topics in data structures and algorithms. I found this platform extremely valuable, and many of the problems you'll see here are solutions to some leetcode problems. 

## Continuous Learning and Updates

This repository is more than just a collection of problems and solutions; it's a testament to my passion for learning and my commitment to enhancing my coding skills. I usually randomly do leetcode problems and solve it and whenever I come across something which I cannot solve, I look at other solutions and most of the time it's related to a concept I didn't know before. For example, I didn't know backtracking or the sliding window approach prior to attempting leetcode. Afterwards, I learn about that concept through YouTube videos. 

While many problems here are from LeetCode, I also like to participate in coding competitions and events. This repository is fairly new so none of the solutions to my past problems I've solved aren't here, but from here on I'll make sure to update this repository with relevant learnings and insights. I'm particularly excited about the upcoming Advent of Code in December!

## Going Forward

I invite you to follow along on this journey of continuous learning and improvement. Feel free to explore the problems, understand the solutions, and even offer your insights. I hope that this repository can serve not just as my personal coding diary, but also as a valuable resource for anyone passionate about data structures and algorithms.
